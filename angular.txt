    ANGULAR - FRONT END TECHNOLOGY
---------------------------------------

1. Angular is a full-featured front-end framework for building web applications.
2. Features of Angular
   - Built with TypeScript
   - Uses components and templates
   - Includes routing, forms, HTTP, and dependency injection
   - Supports standalone APIs (no NgModules needed)
   - Works great for single-page applications (SPAs)
3. Angular compiles your templates into efficient JavaScript and updates the DOM when your component state changes.
4. Install Angular cli : npm i -g @angular/cli
    - Angular commands Works only in in its cli
    - To check angular cli : ng v
5. Angular project creation : ng new project-name
    - to run angular project : npm start / ng serve
    - to view output use localhost:4200

    ------------Basic Commands in Angular-------------------
    - Project creation : ng new project-name
    - to run project : ng s / npm start
    - create component : ng g c component-name
    - create service : ng g s service-folder/service-name
    - create pipes : ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name
    - Creating a route guard : ng generate guard CUSTOM_NAME

6. Components : Reusable piece of codes used to design web application, every component consist of 4 file 
    - component ts file
    - template html file
    - style css file
    - testing spec.ts file
- Default root component of angular app is 'App' Component, its defined in main.ts file
- Decorators : used to provide configuarational metadata, Decorators are preceed with @ symbol
- Selector : used in html page and it will replace its corresponding component template
- Data Binding : Communication between files inside component, it can be of 2 types
    - One way Binding : data flows in one direction at a time
        - component (ts file) to view (html file)
            - String Interpolation : data from component can be used in view within double curly braces {{component data}}
            - Property/Attribute Binding: we can Bind component data with html tag Attribute, [tag-Attribute] = "class Property"
        - view (html) to component (ts) file :
            - Event Binding : (eventName)="function-name()"
            - Event Binding using '$event' as argument : (eventName)="function-name($event)" - $event used to provide information regarding event to binding function in component
            - Event binding using template reference variable : template reference variable used to refer html tag they are variable-name preceed with # symbol
    - Two way binding : data flows in both direction at same time
        - using ngModel : Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element. , used to manage form , [(ngModel)]="class Property"
- Directives : are classes that add additional behavior (manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.) to elements in your Angular applications.
    - types of Angular directives are as follows:
        - Component Directives : Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.
        - Attribute Directives : Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
            - ngClass : Adds and removes a set of CSS classes. import NgClass
            - ngStyle : Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
            - ngModel : Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element, import FormsModule
        - Structural Directives : used to add/remove html element based on component Property
- Control Flow statements : preceed with @ symbol inside html page, @if, @else, @else if, @for, @switch
- Pipe :  special operator in Angular template expressions that allows you to transform data, Angular pipes use the vertical bar character (|)
- Components : are used to design angular application, it can be standalone or group components, to genearate component use command : ng g c component-name
- Set up path for component 
    - Make sure AppConfig file provide Router
    - To set uop path add path object to routes array in app.routes.ts file
    - path object format : {path:'',component:component-class-name}
    - use 'router-outlet' selector in root component inorder to view component in browser according to the path Properly
    - use 'Router' class in component for redirection from one page to another using ts
- Dependency Injection : used to access data from dependent predefined class & services to component, DI can be performed in ways
    - using constructor : constructor(access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name){}
    - using inject() : const class-variable = inject(dependent-class-name)
- Services : used to share common logic between components, so that it reduces coupling between components. 
    - create service : ng g s service-folder/service-name
- Asynchronus function Handling in Angular 
    - use Asynchronus function Handling in rxjs library
    - 'Observable' used in ts to resolve Asynchronus function, Observable can handle multiple Asynchronus function at a time,  An Observable is like a data stream. to get data from Observable use subscribe it gives data whenever it available
    - To resolve Observable use 'subscribe' method, its argument is an object which consist of keys like next , complete, error etc. where next gives resolved state, error gives reject state
- API Call in angular
    - to enable api call in angular add provideHttpClient in app.config.ts file
    - uses HttpClient class, it provides http methods, returns Observable
- Life cycle methods of angular Component
    - ngOnChanges : it calls when input Property of component changes
    - ngOnInit : Component is initialised, it called only once, 
    - ngDoCheck : Changes detection trigger, it called every time angular detect changes
    - ngAfterContentInit : 
    - ngAfterContentChecked : 
    - ngAfterViewInit : 
    - ngAfterViewChecked
    - ngOnDestroy
- Form Handling in Angular
    - Template Driven forms : use ngModel, first design html page then get dta from form using ngModel 
    - Model Driven forms : first create model for the form in ts file, then link model with html form, example is
        - Reactive Forms : Import ReactiveFormsModule, It consist of 3 parts
            - Form group : uses formBuilder class instance, similar model, used to link form tag to model
            - Form array : used to hold input tag, also can pass validation using Validator global class
            - Form Control : used to link input tag with form group
- ActivatedRoute : class used to access information regarding dynamic values of a url associated with a component
- Signal : used to track its own dependecis and notifies angular whenever its value changes
    - create signal : signal-variable-name = signal(initaial-value)
    - to read signal : signal-variable-name()
    - upadte signal  with a new vale : signal-variable-name.set(new-value)
